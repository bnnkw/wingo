		pages.  Select a window to go to.

		Each entry is displayed as: >
		  > Tab:1 Win:2 [+] filename
<
		">" marks the current window.  "[+]" indicates
		unsaved changes.

:WinGoHistory		Show the history.

POPUP MENU KEYS						*wingo-keys*

The following keys are available in the popup menu:

	key	  effect ~
	j	  select next entry
	k	  select previous entry
	<Down>	  select next entry
	<Up>	  select previous entry
	<C-n>	  select next entry

	<Esc>	  cancel and return to original window
	<C-c>	  cancel and return to original window

							*wingo-preview*
Preview ~

Pressing `p` in the popup menu opens a side popup showing the content
of the selected window's buffer.  Press `p` again to close it.
Moving the selection also closes the preview.

==============================================================================
History						*wingo-history*

WinGo has a history that works like |jumplist|.

A window is added to the history on two occasions: when you press
<CR> in the popup menu opened by |:WinGo|, and when you execute
|:WinGoHistoryPrev|.  In the former case, the window where the popup
was opened is remembered.  In the latter, the window where the
command was executed is remembered.

A window is not added if it is the same as the most recent entry
in the history.

The history holds up to 10 entries.  When the limit is exceeded,
the oldest entry is removed.

If a new window is added while navigating through the history,
the entries after the current position are discarded and a new
history is started from there, just like |jumplist-stack|.

Use |:WinGoHistoryPrev| and |:WinGoHistoryNext| to navigate
the history, and |:WinGoHistory| to show the current entries.
